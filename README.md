How to handle thousands of images of your original artwork?

I've been taking pictures of my original art since 2011 and now have over 2k jpegs or various quality. Being a decent TSQL developer and SQL Server enthusiast, I decided to try out the filetable feature with my art. Can I create SSRS reports and organize abstract images based on Azure AI tools? 

I needed to bulk move the images while normalizaing a few things: DPI, width and hieght. I also wanted to create a log of the changes and capture meta data about the directory structure where the orginal images were stored. This script parameters: rootDirectory, ignoreList, movingDirectory, logName, height, width.

Hope other artists find us and our work helps others.
